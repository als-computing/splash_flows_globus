### Summary of `config.yaml`

The `config.yaml` file contains configurations for various components involved in the data management, processing, and orchestration workflows related to the ALS beamlines.

#### **Globus Endpoints**
- **globus_endpoints**: Defines multiple Globus endpoints used for data transfer between various systems.
  - **spot832**, **data832**, **alcf832**, **nersc832**, etc., each has specific configurations like:
    - `root_path`: The root directory for data storage.
    - `uri`: The URI for accessing the endpoint.
    - `uuid`: Unique identifier for each endpoint.
    - `name`: Descriptive name for the endpoint.
  - These endpoints represent different storage locations across systems like ALS, ALCF, and NERSC.

#### **Globus Apps**
- **globus_apps**: Defines the application configurations needed for Globus transfers, such as the `als_transfer` app, with environment variables for `client_id` and `client_secret`.

#### **Harbor Images**
- **harbor_images832**: Specifies the image for tomography reconstruction (`recon_image`) and multi-resolution conversion (`multires_image`) in the Harbor registry.

#### **GHCR Images**
- **ghcr_images832**: Specifies the same tomography images as above but stored in the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for easier access during workflows.

#### **Prefect**
- **prefect.deployments**: Defines the Prefect flow deployments, including unique identifiers (`uuid`) for specific flows related to file processing, like `new_file_832`.

#### **SciCat**
- **scicat**: Configures the SciCat metadata service used for ingesting jobs and managing metadata. It includes the `jobs_api_url` for the API used to track and ingest jobs into the SciCat platform.

### Key Configuration Highlights:
- The YAML defines detailed configurations for each endpoint, ensuring smooth integration between systems like Globus, ALCF, NERSC, and data832.
- Provides details for image containers used in tomography processes and how to access them.
- Specifies the integration of SciCat for metadata tracking and the Prefect orchestration system for scheduling workflows.
