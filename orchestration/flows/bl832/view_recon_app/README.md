# Tomography Reconstruction Visualizer

## (Powered by itk-vtk-viewer)

This web application allows users to load their reconstructed volumes using Tiled Browser (in development) into the itk-vtk-viewer widget, all within the same web page.

TODO:
- Add a 'listener' mode that loads in the most recent tomographic reconstruction once processing is completed and the data is available.
